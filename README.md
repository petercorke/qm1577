# qm1577

This is an unfinished weekend project from years ago that I never really finished.  I've put it on GitHub in the hope it might be useful to others.

It's MATLAB code to read from a QM-1577 DMM a pretty cool multimeter/scope with a serial interface (with a SiliconLabs serial to USB converter) that lets you upload measurements and waveforms.
The first version was writte in MATLAB and worked somewhat, and the Python version is very incomplete.  I can't find the source I originally used to get
started.

There is no driver on [sigrok]() for this instrument.
